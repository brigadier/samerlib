# Samerlib: Some Addictive Modules, Erlang Library

The acronym is not fixed, if a better one comes up, we will update it.

# What is this?

A collection of common functionality that can be useful for a lot of different
projects. It is the kind of application that wants to be named "stuff" or
"misc," or even "misc stuff."

# Compiling

Just typing `make` should do the trick. You need Internet access to download the
dependencies.

# Testing

`make test` will run all the tests and produce a coverage report.

`make check` will run static checks (xref currently).
